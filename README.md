A big red button.

## What?

It's a big red button which acts as a keyboard input. Using the Digistump ATTINY85
it can act as a single key or send any text.

## Why?

I needed a prop for a live demo. Even better that it functions as a real keyboard.
I think at some point I'll start using it as a play/pause media button, or see if I
can set up some macros.
